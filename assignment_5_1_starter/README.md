The assignment sought to compare acceptance rates of
coupons based on the coupon bearer's specific features.

Key findings:

People under 30 who go to bars more than once a month are more likely to accept the coupon. (63%)

Also, people who go to bars more than once and have no kids, and those who go to a bar more than once and are not in farming and fishing have virtually the same acceptance rate (62%)

People who never go to bars are less likely to accept the coupon (53%)
