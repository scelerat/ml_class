This project started as an attempt to build a Q&A system using a Document Querying Pipeline.

I wanted to export a model and host it on AWS, but I could not get the model to run using AWS's available resources in the time I had available to me for this assignment.

In this directory is [a notebook showing the process of building a document querying pipeline and an examples of questions and answers that the query gives](./DocumentQueryingPipeline.ipynb).

This shows my process of preparing the data and building the pipeline.
